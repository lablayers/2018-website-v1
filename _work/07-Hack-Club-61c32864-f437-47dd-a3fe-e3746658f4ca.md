# Homepage Design

I created a homepage that answers the nonprofit's age-old questions of “What is a hack club?” to students, teachers, and parents. It shows that coding can be fun and inspires students to start their own Hack Club.

There are also tinier details all over the place, such as these tiny hover effects:

# Inclusive Avatars

It is well know that the tech industry has a diversity problem, and Hack Club was founded on the belief that coding is for everyone. I created a simple avatar system that represents the diversity of students everywhere.

I also worked on a few smaller things within their design system, including tiled patterns and business cards:
