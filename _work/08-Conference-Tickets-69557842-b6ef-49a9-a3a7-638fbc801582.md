**I can't say much about this right now since this project is (mostly) under wraps, but here's a sneak peek of what I will write about:**

## Introduction

I worked with a conference to architect and build a streamlined event ticketing system that incorporates a lot of elements that would otherwise be found elsewhere. I can't say much about this right now since this project is (mostly) under wraps, but here's a sneak peek of what I will write about:

## A Streamlined API

A robust API was (over)engineered to streamline item listings and order information.

## Upgrades and Additions

The systems allows a user to enter a confirmation code that will allow an upgrade or add existing items. Additionally, items can be transferred to other people.

## Motion

The use of motion allows us to indicate changes in the cart. (For people with reduced motion enabled, a highlight appears instead.)

## Pay with (Almost) Anything

Thanks to the power of Stripe, users can pay using Apple Pay, Google Pay, Microsoft Pay. Or you could just enter a plain old card number. There isn't yet another event site out there that supports these newfangled payment methods! :wink:

## Happier Customers

(Something will go here once this thing has been live for a few months!)
